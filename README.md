# purescript-puzzler
Browser-based puzzle game written in purescript.

This is a game a I made as a learning exercise to explore:

* Model-View-Intent architecture for applications.
* `purescript-signal` library for FRP.
* `virtual-dom` for stateless GUI rendering.

The code itself is pretty messy as I explored different concepts and tried to
figure out various quirks of the constituent libraries, so please do not use
this as an example of good architecture or style.

You can play the game [here](http://fluffynukeit.github.io/purescript-puzzler/)
